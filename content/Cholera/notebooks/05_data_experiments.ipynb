    "There are many ways to do an experiment with data. The methods we use depend on a variety of things like the question we are trying to answer, what kind of data we are working with and how we hope to communicate our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "You used correlations before to explore whether there is a positive, negative (or no!) relationship between two variables. You also assessed how strong this relationship is and whether it is statistically significant. In this case, the variables had values that ranged across a whole continuum of numbers, i.e. they were **continuously distributed**. For example, population density could be a number anywhere between 0 and infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you’ll do in this notebook is convert continuously distributed data into **categorical data** (categories). Why? Because you can  group your data in a way that allows you to compare the outcome in one group to that of another group, contingent on a condition. The condition will be the potential explanation you want to explore across groups to see if it has a differential impact. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the airborne and waterborne theories, we can separate people into groups. The exposed group (people living near a sewer or the water pump) is often called an **impact** or **treatment group** while the unexposed group (people living far from a sewer or the water pump) is the **control group**. When testing the waterborne theory, we will group people based on whether they lived near a sewer or not and whether they died of cholera or not. When testing the airborne theory, we will group people based on whether they lived near a certain water pump or not and whether they died of cholera or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will result in four groups for each proposed explanation. We will place them in a 2x2 **contingency table** (also called a ***two-way table*** or ***crosstab***). We will have to test each explanation separately. In all, that means four contingency tables: an expected (null) and an observed table for each of the two hypotheses."
