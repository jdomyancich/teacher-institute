    "# Standing on Shoulders: Functions, Modules, and Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "In any scientific discipline, from chemistry to physics and biology, our work relies on performing calculations, analyzing data, and visualizing results. Writing code from scratch for every single task would be incredibly inefficient and prone to errors. This is where three fundamental concepts in programming become essential: **functions**, **modules**, and **libraries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions**: Think of a function as a reusable recipe for a specific calculation. Instead of writing out the steps to calculate molar mass every time you need it, you can define a `calculate_molar_mass` function once. This makes your code cleaner, easier to read, and significantly reduces the chance of making a copy-paste error. If you need to update the logic, you only have to change it in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modules and Libraries**: If functions are individual recipes, then modules and libraries are entire cookbooks written by experts\n",
    "- **Module**: a Python file containing a collection of related functions and variables.\n",
    "- **Library**: a larger collection of modules, often focused on a specific domain. For scientific computing, libraries are indispensable. They provide highly optimized, pre-written tools for complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "By standing on the shoulders of these powerful tools, scientists can focus on their research questions rather than on the low-level details of programming. In this notebook, we will explore how to create our own simple functions and how to import and use pre-existing modules to solve chemical problems."

In Python, the two primary scopes you'll encounter are local and global.\n",
