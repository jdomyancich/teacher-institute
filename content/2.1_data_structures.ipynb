You can think of a DataFrame as a smart, programmable spreadsheet, like Excel or Google Sheets, but with the full power of Python behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll look into the structure of a dataframe and walk through the most critical first steps to take immediately after loading a dataset into a pandas as a dataframe. Think of this as the initial \"health check\" for your data, a fundamental skill for any data analyst or scientist.\n",

Mastering these first few commands builds a solid foundation for all your future data work and prevents common errors down the line."
